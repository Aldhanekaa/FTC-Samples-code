### First of all what is FTC (FIRST-Tech-Challenge)?

The FIRST Tech Challenge seeks to inspire youth to become the next generation of STEM leaders and innovators through participation in mentor-guided robotics competition. Teams who participate in the FIRST Tech Challenge must build a robot that performs a variety of tasks. The tasks vary from season to season, and are based on a set of game rules that are published at the start of each season. The more tasks that a robot can complete, the more points a team will earn.

## What is the purpose of this Repo?
I create this repo to showing you FTC Sample code and helps you to understand Java programming language for Robot and improve your code more readable with see the samples code.

Feel free to contribute!
